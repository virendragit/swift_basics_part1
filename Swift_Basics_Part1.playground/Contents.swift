/*  Type Safe
    Swift is type-safe Language, Which means the language helps you to be clear about the types of value your code can work with. If part of your code requires a String ,type safety prevents you from passing it an Int by mistake, Likewise, Type Safety Prevents you from accidently passing a optional String to piece of code that requires a non-optional String, Type safety helps you catch and fix error as early as possible in the development process.

var x = 0.0, y = 0.0, z = 1.0

//Note: If a stored value in the code won't change, always declear it as constant using let keyword, Use variables only for storing values that will change.

//Type Annotation:
var message : String
var red, gree, blue : Double

let someMessage : String

someMessage = "hello"

print(someMessage)


//Naming constant and variables.

/* Constant and variable names can contain any character, Including Unicode characters */

let someLiteral = "Some Value"

//Printing variables and constables.
print("The current value of friendlyWelcome is \(friendlyWelcome) ")

print("Value of someLiteral is \(üê∂üêÆ)")

//Comments

//This a single line comment

/* This are multiline
 comments*/

//Semicolons
/* Swift doesn't require you to write a semicolon(;) after each statement in code,
 although you can do so if you want to, Semicolons are required if you want to write
 mutiple separate statements on a single line*/

let cat = "cat" ; print(cat)


//Integers
/*
 Integers are whole numbers with no fractional component such as 42 and -22.
 
 Integers are either signed (positive,zero,negative) or unsigned(positive or zero).
 
 Swift Provides signed and unsigned integers in 8, 16, 32, and 64bit forms.
  
 These integers follow a naming convention similar to C, 8-bit unsined integer is : UInt8
 
 and 32-bit signed interger is Int32.
